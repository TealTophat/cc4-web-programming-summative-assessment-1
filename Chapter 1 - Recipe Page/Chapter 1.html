<p>
	<center>This is one of my first experiences in cooking, and is still a dish I love to make and eat. For a little bit of context, Beef Nilaga (or Nilagang Baka) is a Filipino dish that is simple to prepare, and can accomodate a good amount of people. There are other varieties of this recipe, but this recipe is what I usually use. 
Additionally, this recipe was originally by Vanjo Merano, a man who also has a popular cooking channel known as "Panlasang Pinoy."</center>
