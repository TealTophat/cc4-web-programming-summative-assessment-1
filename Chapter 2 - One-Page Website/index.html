This game revolves around a flexible arsenal of weapons that not only boast massive firepower, but also synergize with each other. Make the most of your weapons' capabilities by performing brutal combos that will guarantee to leave your enemies as a fine red mist.
However, your character is a machine that runs on blood, so you must acquire your fuel through the blood of your enemies. Taking cover isn't the best option, as you'll slowly run out of blood; this game encourages an aggressive playstyle through its innovative health system that is guaranteed to keep any player on their toes.

that nowhere on the surface of the Earth was safe. However, in the end, it was war without reason. <br>
The machines eventually ran out of power, and mankind had to reconclie and make peace. <br>
However, that peace did not last long...<br>
