This game revolves around a flexible arsenal of weapons that not only boast massive firepower, but also synergize with each other. Make the most of your weapons' capabilities by performing brutal combos that will guarantee to leave your enemies as a fine red mist.

Taking cover isn't the best option, as you'll slowly run out of blood; this game encourages an aggressive playstyle through its innovative health system that is guaranteed to keep any player on their toes.
